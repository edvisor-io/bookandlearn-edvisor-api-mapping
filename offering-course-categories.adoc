# Course Catgories

In Edvisor there is a single property to define the type and category of a course. This is the query to get all categories 

.offeringCourseCategoryQuery.gql
[source,graphql]
...
query  {
  offeringCourseCategories{
    offeringCourseCategoryId
    left
    right
    depth
  }
}
...

As you'll see by the properties `left` and `right` categories has a hierarchical structure as they use a link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nested_set_model[Nested Set Model]. 

We can consider the first level of the hierarchy (`depth = 0`) as the `courseType`, for example: 

- LANGUAGES
- VOCATIONAL
- HIGHER_EDUCATION

And the second and third level of the hierarchy as the category

- ENGLISH > ENGLISH_PLUS
- ENGLISH > JUNIOR_PROGRAM
